# Python-works
A repository where I deposit my new Python programs. Please mention me in your projects if you reuse my code. Thanks!

# Testing the files
To test my programs, you have to have a Python interpreter and an IDE (such as VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter-Lab, Jupyter-Notebook, Spyder, etc.).
Good testing!
