# Python-works
A repository where I deposit my new Python programs. WARNING: This code is NOT open-source. Any public/published modification by another person is forbidden without the authorization of the owner. The owner (tux-linux) must be cited in the program that you modify.

# Testing the files
To test my programs, you have to have a Python interpreter and an IDE (such as VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter-Lab, Jupyter-Notebook, Spyder, etc.).
Good testing!
